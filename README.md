# ACC_project

This Python file is designed to identify students who cheat by copying others' homework code. The script analyzes code similarities and detects patterns that suggest plagiarism. For a more detailed explanation of how this works, you can refer to the "ACC_Code_w_explain.ipynb" notebook in my repository. There, I provide an in-depth discussion on the algorithms and techniques used, as well as examples of how the program can be applied to real-world scenarios.
